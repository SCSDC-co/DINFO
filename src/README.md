# DINFO LAYERS

</div>

Dinfo is divided into two layers:

- **[CORE](https://github.com/SCSDC-co/DINFO/tree/main/src/core)** is the core layer that contains the main classes and interfaces.
- **[TUI](https://github.com/SCSDC-co/DINFO/tree/main/src/tui)** is the UI layer that contains the user interface.
